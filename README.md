OMDB API
=================

MiniProject from Week 2 at GA_WDI

==

A simple website to practice proper use of API calls, `JSON` parsing, and `html.erb` files.  Using the [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) API, this applet returns a movie's image, and their roten tomatoes information.  It uses Amazon's iMDb database and RottenTomatoes for reviews.
